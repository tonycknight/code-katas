# Random Sequence

## About this kata

We want you to write a class whose single method will give an infinite sequence of random numbers:

```csharp
public IEnumerable<int> GetRandomValues()
{
  // implementation goes here
}

```

### What you can do, and what you must have:

- The method *must* match the above signature
- The method *must* provide random numbers
- You *must* have tests covering *all* aspects of your code

## We need unit tests!

We're hot on test driven development, in the pure style, and that means test first and test often. Remember your early tutorials on TDD? That's what we practice.

## Questions you might want to think about

* What is the best way to verify your tests are correct?

* Can you factor the code for elegance and readability?

* How would you test with the minimum number of tests and test cases?

* After you've proven functional correctness, how would you achieve best performance? What trade-offs will you need?
