_This problem was inspired via [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)._


We want you to write a method that, given an input of a collection of positive integers (``values`` and a number ``k``) return whether any **two** numbers from the list add up to ``k``.


Example:

```
values = [10, 15, 3, 7]

k = 17

result = true

```


```
values = [3, 7, 100]

k = 20

result = false

```


In additional:

* ``values`` can contain zero or more items.
* ``values`` can have repeated numbers of the same value.


## Questions you might want to think about

* Can you factor the code for elegance and readability?

* How would you test with the minimum number of tests and test cases?

* What is the best way to verify your tests are correct?

* After you've proven functional correctness, how would you ensure no worse than ``O(n)`` time complexity and ``O(n)`` resource complexity?
