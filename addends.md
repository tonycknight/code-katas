# Addends

## About this Kata ##

We want you to write a method that, given a collection of positive integers (``values``) and a number (``k``), will return whether any **two** numbers from ``values`` add up to ``k``.


Examples:

```
values = [10, 15, 3, 7]

k = 17

result := true

```


```
values = [3, 7, 100]

k = 20

result := false

```


In additional:

* ``values`` can contain zero or more items.
* ``values`` can have repeated numbers of the same value.


## We also need unit tests!

We're hot on test driven development, in the pure style, and that means test first and test often. Remember your early tutorials on TDD? That's what we practice.


## Questions you might want to think about

* What is the best way to verify your tests are correct?

* Can you factor the code for elegance and readability?

* How would you test with the minimum number of tests and test cases?

* After you've proven functional correctness, how would you ensure no worse than ``O(n)`` time complexity and ``O(n)`` resource complexity?
